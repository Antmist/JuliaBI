# JuliaBI
BI report deployment made as easy as commitng code to your Git repo

In Work...

Coming soon - 
  The plan is to use Julia and Gogs/Gitea to create a series of docker containers that allow the developer to build BI dashboards then commit the dashboard programs to a self hosted git repo.  At that point the JuliaBI tools go to work to auto update the dashboards to a web application server and a modified executible that builds an electron desktop viewer for dashboard reports. Essiantially the initial work is to make Julia Dashboard deployment as flexible and easy to use so technical solutions in business can be easily distributed to non-technical users in the business orginisations.
  
  Then once the distribution and deployment tools become avalable I plan to build the remainder of the processes with one goal in mind. Make programming statistical dashboard programming in julia as easy as posible, looking towards uses in educating future programmers without overwelming them and make Julia a practical solution that can keep up with the most demanding of business reporting needs.
  
  After some needed foundational programming gets completed I will add a better organized road map so project goals can be clearly understood and met.
